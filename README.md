# Muhammad-Imran-Mushtaq

Hi, I’m Muhammad Imran Mushtaq, I’m a data enthusiast and problem-solver with a unique mix of public-sector leadership and technical expertise. Formerly the Service Center Incharge at Punjab Land Records Authority (PLRA), I managed Arazi Record Centers, streamlining land record services like ‘Fard’ issuance and mutation processing. I handled ops, team coordination, and data workflows—making sure everything ran smoothly and transparently.

Before that, I built Print Management Information Systems at PrintMIS, diving deep into system design and optimization. Recently, I leveled up my skills with MIT’s Applied Data Science Program, mastering tools like Python, SQL, and machine learning to turn data into actionable insights.

### What I’m About
- 🔍 Analyzing and optimizing processes with data  
- 💻 Coding practical solutions for real-world problems  
- 🌱 Exploring intersections of tech, governance, and analytics  
📌 Featured Projects
🏡 Malaria Detection – Repository
Leveraged Deep learning and Computer vision modeling to detect the Malaria.

🍽 Business Data Analysis: Food HUB – Repository
Optimized restaurant performance using SQL, Python, and Tableau to identify customer demand trends.

📌 Algorithms I Have Experience With
I have worked with a wide range of machine learning, deep learning, and statistical algorithms, applying them to real-world datasets across finance, marketing, business analytics, and climate science. Below is a categorized list of the algorithms I have experience with:

🔹 Supervised Learning Algorithms
✔ Linear Regression – Predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., sales forecasting, house prices) ✔ Logistic Regression – Binary classification problems (e.g., fraud detection, churn prediction) ✔ Decision Trees – Intuitive classification and regression models ✔ Random Forest – Ensemble learning for improved accuracy and stability ✔ Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) – High-performance predictive modeling ✔ Support Vector Machines (SVM) – Complex classification problems ✔ k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) – Instance-based learning for pattern recognition

🔹 Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
✔ K-Means Clustering – Customer segmentation, market analysis ✔ Hierarchical Clustering – Identifying natural groupings in data ✔ DBSCAN – Density-based clustering for anomaly detection ✔ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – Dimensionality reduction for feature selection ✔ t-SNE & UMAP – High-dimensional data visualization

🔹 Time Series & Forecasting Models
✔ ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) – Time series forecasting ✔ SARIMA & Prophet – Seasonal time series forecasting ✔ LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory Networks) – Deep learning for sequential data

🔹 Deep Learning & Neural Networks
✔ Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) – Basic neural network architectures ✔ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – Image classification and feature extraction ✔ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – Sequential data analysis ✔ Transformers (BERT, GPT, T5) – Natural Language Processing (NLP) ✔ Autoencoders – Anomaly detection, feature engineering ✔ GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) – Synthetic data generation

🔹 Recommendation Systems
✔ Collaborative Filtering (User-Based & Item-Based) – Personalized recommendations ✔ Matrix Factorization (SVD, ALS) – Latent factor modeling ✔ Hybrid Recommendation Systems – Combining multiple techniques

🔹 Anomaly Detection & Optimization
✔ Isolation Forest – Detecting rare events and anomalies ✔ One-Class SVM – Outlier detection in high-dimensional data ✔ Genetic Algorithms – Optimization and search problems

I have applied these algorithms using Python (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, StatsModels, H2O.ai) and have optimized models for business intelligence, finance, marketing, and climate data science. 🚀
